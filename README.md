# Self_balancing_robot

This project was done back in 2021 and was recently added to my github.


## Simlulation
In order to realize our simulation, we used the VRsink block on simulink which is a tool allowing to create a virtual reality. So we started by making a simplified 3D model of the robot on VRlearm.

## Material
- 2 steppers nema 23.
- 2 batteries 12V.
- 2 DM556 drivers.
- 1 ESP32.
- 1 MPU6050.
- 1 L7805CV regulator.
- 2 capacities 10Î¼F.
- 2 wheels 10cm diameter (We made the 3D model of the wheels on Solidworks and printed them)
- 120cm threaded rod.
- 4 wooden boards (9.5x20)
